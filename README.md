# Intentgine for Home Assistant

Control your Home Assistant devices using natural language powered by [Intentgine](https://intentgine.dev).

## What is This?

This is a custom Home Assistant integration that lets you control your smart home devices using natural language commands. Instead of remembering exact entity names and service calls, just type what you want:

- "Turn on the living room lights"
- "Set bedroom temperature to 72"
- "Activate movie time scene"
- "Dim the kitchen lights to 50%"

The integration uses Intentgine's Intent-as-a-Service API to understand your commands and map them to the correct Home Assistant actions.

## Features

- 🗣️ **Natural Language Control**: Type commands in plain English
- 🏠 **Area-Based Organization**: Automatically organizes devices by room
- 🔄 **Auto-Sync**: Keeps up with your Home Assistant configuration changes
- 🔒 **Secure**: Only controls entities you've exposed to voice assistants
- 💬 **Conversational**: Optional chat interface with natural responses
- 🎯 **Accurate**: Learns from corrections to improve over time

## Requirements

- Home Assistant 2024.1 or newer
- Active [Intentgine](https://intentgine.dev) subscription
- Intentgine API key

## Installation

### Via HACS (Recommended)

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant
2. Click "Integrations"
3. Click the three dots in the top right
4. Select "Custom repositories"
5. Add this repository URL
6. Click "Install"
7. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release
2. Copy `custom_components/intentgine/` to your Home Assistant `config/custom_components/` directory
3. Restart Home Assistant

## Configuration

### 1. Get Your Intentgine API Key

1. Sign up at [intentgine.dev](https://intentgine.dev)
2. Create a new App in the dashboard
3. Copy your API key (starts with `sk_live_`)

### 2. Add the Integration

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Click **Add Integration**
3. Search for "Intentgine"
4. Enter your API key
5. Click **Submit**

The integration will automatically:
- Discover all entities exposed to voice assistants
- Create toolsets organized by area
- Sync with Intentgine API

### 3. Expose Entities (Optional)

By default, only entities already exposed to voice assistants can be controlled. To expose more:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Voice Assistants** → **Expose**
2. Select entities you want to control via Intentgine
3. The integration will auto-sync within a few minutes

## Usage

### Dashboard Card

Add the Intentgine command card to your dashboard:

```yaml
type: custom:intentgine-command-card
title: Voice Command
placeholder: "What would you like to do?"
show_history: true
```

Then just type commands and click "Run"!

### Chat Interface (Advanced)

For a more conversational experience:

```yaml
type: custom:intentgine-chat-card
title: Home Assistant Chat
persona: friendly
show_resolved_actions: true
```

### Conversation Agent (Coming Soon)

Integration with Home Assistant's built-in voice assistant system.

## Example Commands

### Lights
- "Turn on the living room lights"
- "Turn off all bedroom lights"
- "Set kitchen lights to 50%"
- "Make the lights warmer"
- "Change living room to blue"

### Climate
- "Set bedroom temperature to 72"
- "Turn on the AC"
- "Set thermostat to heat mode"

### Scenes
- "Activate movie time"
- "Turn on good morning scene"

### Covers
- "Open the garage door"
- "Close bedroom blinds"

### Media
- "Play music in the living room"
- "Pause the TV"

## How It Works

1. **You type a command** in natural language
2. **Integration classifies** the command to determine the area (living room, bedroom, etc.)
3. **Integration sends to Intentgine** with the area-specific toolset
4. **Intentgine resolves** the command to a specific action with parameters
5. **Integration executes** the Home Assistant service call
6. **You get feedback** on success or errors

The integration automatically creates "toolsets" (collections of available actions) organized by area. Each toolset contains domain-based tools (one tool for all lights, one for all switches, etc.) with parameters to specify which device and what action. When you add or remove devices, it syncs automatically.

**Note**: Each command uses 2 API requests (1 for classification, 1 for resolution).

## Configuration Options

Access via **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **Intentgine** → **Configure**:

- **API Endpoint**: Custom endpoint (for self-hosted Intentgine)
- **Sync Frequency**: How often to sync toolsets (hourly, daily, manual)
- **Area Toolsets**: Enable/disable area-based organization
- **Default Persona**: Conversational style for responses

## Troubleshooting

### "I don't understand that command"

- Make sure the entity is exposed to voice assistants
- Try being more specific (include room name)
- Check that the device is available in Home Assistant

### "API key invalid"

- Verify your API key in the Intentgine dashboard
- Make sure it starts with `sk_live_`
- Try reconfiguring the integration

### "Out of requests"

- Check your Intentgine plan limits
- Upgrade your plan or wait for reset
- View usage in the Intentgine dashboard

### Commands are slow

- First command after sync may be slower (cache miss)
- Subsequent similar commands should be faster (cached)
- Check your internet connection

### Entities not syncing

- Trigger manual sync: **Developer Tools** → **Services** → `intentgine.sync_toolsets`
- Check entity is exposed to voice assistants
- Check integration logs for errors

## Advanced Usage

### Memory Banks

The integration can learn from corrections:

1. When a command doesn't work as expected, use the correction UI
2. The integration sends the correction to Intentgine
3. Future similar commands will work better

### Custom Toolsets

For advanced users, you can customize toolset generation in the integration options.

## Pricing

This integration is **free and open source**. However, it requires an Intentgine subscription:

- **Hobbyist**: $5/mo - 10,000 requests (5,000 commands) - Small homes (2 areas, ~30 devices)
- **Starter**: $29/mo - 100,000 requests (50,000 commands) - Medium homes (4-5 areas, ~80 devices)
- **Business**: $99/mo - 500,000 requests (250,000 commands) - Large homes (9-10 areas, ~150+ devices)

See [intentgine.dev/pricing](https://intentgine.dev/pricing) for current pricing.

Each command uses **2 requests** (1 for area classification, 1 for command resolution).

**Recommendation**: Most users should start with **Starter ($29/mo)** for typical home setups.
